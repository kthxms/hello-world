# hello-world
My first repository
I am passionate about self discovery, betterment, and organization, and am currently trying to find a path in life in which I can be content and fullfilled. I am excited to find out if learning Data Science could become a big part of my search, and so far I am loving every bit that I am getting to learn about it.
